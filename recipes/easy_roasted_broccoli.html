  <h3>What about it?</h3>
  <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome 
    than boiled. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <dd>
      <dt>Step 1</dt>
      <dl>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</dl>
      <dt>Step 2</dt>
      <dl>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice 
        into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking
         sheet; season with salt and pepper.
      </dl>
      <dt>Step 3</dt>
      <dl>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned,
         about 18 to 20 minutes.</dl>
